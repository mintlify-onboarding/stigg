## Overview

The Stigg React SDK is a Javascript library for implementing pricing and packaging in React apps with Stigg. it provides plug and play components and custom React hooks.

> ### 📚

> [Full SDK reference ↗️](https://react-sdk-docs.stigg.io/)

## Installing the SDK

You have a few options for using the `@stigg/react-sdk` package in your project:

#### From npm:

Shell

`npm install @stigg/react-sdk
`

#### From yarn:

Shell

`yarn add @stigg/react-sdk
`

## Retrieving the client API key

In the Stigg Cloud Console, go to [Settings > Account > Environments](https://app.stigg.io/account/settings).

Copy the   **Client API key** of the relevant environment.

## Getting started

First, you'll need to wrap your application in a single `StiggProvider` component. that will provide the React Context to components that are placed inside your application:

React

`import React from 'react';  
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  
import { StiggProvider } from '@stigg/react-sdk';  
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(  
  <StiggProvider apiKey="YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY">  
    <App />  
  </StiggProvider>,  
  document.getElementById('app'),  
);
`

### Importing the styles

If you plan to use the widget components, add an import statement to include the bundled styles:

TypeScript

`import '@stigg/react-sdk/dist/styles.css';
`

## Rendering pricing tables

Pricing tables allow your customers to select the plan that that they'd like to subscribe to. Plan pickers can be used on your **public pricing page**, as well as part of **in-app paywalls**.

One of the major benefits of leverage Stigg's pricing table widget, is that any change that you make to your pricing model is auto-magically reflected in the pricing table - no additional coding is required 😎.

![](/images/91addcf-image.png)

To render a pricing table, use the `Paywall` component:

React

`<Paywall  
  highlightedPlanId="plan-id"  
  onPlanSelected={({ plan, customer }) => {  
    // Handle customer intention to subscribe to plan  
  }}  
/>
`

> ### 📘
> 
> Stigg's pricing table widget can be fully customized to align with the UI of your website and application, more details can be found [here](#customization-options).
> 
> Additional configurations and **localization** options can be found [here](https://react-sdk-docs.stigg.io/types/paywallprops)

  
## Rendering a customer portal

Stigg's customer portal widget allows you to introduce self-service and drive in-app expansions using only a few lines of codes. 

The customer portal:

1. Provides customers with visibility to their current subscription details - subscribed plan, purchased add-ons, granted promotional entitlements.
2. Provides customers with visibility to the usage of their subscription's features.
3. Allows customers to upgrade and downgrade their subscription in a self-served manner - when you update your pricing model in Stigg, customers will auto-magically be able to upgrade or downgrade their subscription according to the updated pricing model 😎.
4. Allows customers to view their billing and payment information - when Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (such as Stripe), customers can also update this information and view previous invoices directly from the billing solution's billing portal.

The widget's layout, style and texts are [fully customizable](#customization-options) to suit your branding needs.

![](/images/773b08a-image.png)

Rendering the customer portal can be achieved using 2 steps:

1. Set the customer ID, the customer ID can usually be retrieved after a customer signs-in or restores their session.  
TypeScript  
`import { useStiggContext } from '@stigg/react-sdk';  
function App() {  
  const { stigg } = useStiggContext();  
  useEffect(() => {  
    // After user sign in call to setCustomerId  
    stigg.setCustomerId('customer-ID');  
  })  
}  
`
2. Use the `CustomerPortal` component to render the customer portal.  
The CustomerPortal component support [component composition](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html) so it's possible to pass as a parameter the Paywall component and it will be rendered inside the customer portal.  
React TSX  
`<CustomerPortal  
    paywallComponent={<Paywall />}  
    theme={...}  
    textOverrides={...}  
/>  
`

### Subscriptions with a custom price

Customers that are subscribed to a subscription with a custom price can't upgrade on downgrade their subscription in a self-served manner using the customer portal widget. Instead, you can handle the `onContactSupport` method to allow customers contact a sales or customer success representative that can do so on their behalf.

### Updating billing information and viewing invoices

When Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (such as Stripe), customers are able to update their billing information and view previous invoices directly from the billing solution's billing portal.

To ensure that the functionality of Stigg's Customer Portal doesn't collide with that of the billing solution's billing portal, the billing portal must be configured accordingly.

### Widget modularity

The `CustomerPortal` component is just an opinionated way to render the customer portal in a specific layout which is based on our experience after reviewing many customer portals, but if you want more customization in the way the customer portal is rendered, then you can use directly the inner components as a standalone.

In order to use the standalone component, it's required to wrap all the components with `CustomerPortalProvider` which will pass the necessary data to each component:

React

`import { 
  CustomerPortalProvider,
  CustomerUsageData,
  BillingInformation,
  /* more components that can be used as standalone
  SubscriptionsOverview,
  AddonsList,
  Promotions,
  */
} from '@stigg/react-sdk"

function App() {
    return (
        <CustomerPortalProvider theme={...} textOverrides={...}>
            <CustomerUsageData />
            <BillingInformation />
        </CustomerPortalProvider>    
  )
}

`

## Customization options

The components included in of this package comes with default styling, and you can customize and change the appearance.

### Global customization options

You can pass customization options such as theming and locale to `StiggProvider` component.  
It will affect all Stigg components that are descendent to the provider, this is useful in order to pass your own branding colors palette or typography.

React

`import React from 'react';  
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  
import { StiggProvider } from '@stigg/react-sdk';  
import App from './App';

// Example of the options that are available for the theme  
const theme = {  
  palette: {  
    primary: '#FFA500',  
    backgroundPaper: '#fcfbf8',  
    backgroundHighlight: '#FFF3E0',  
    outlinedHoverBackground: '#FFE0B2',
    text: {

};

ReactDOM.render(  
  <StiggProvider apiKey="YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY" theme={theme} locale="de-DE">

  document.getElementById('app'),  
);
`

### Component level customization options

You can pass customization options per component.

#### Paywall component

React

`` const textOverrides = {  
    highlightChip: 'Best value',  
    planCTAButton: {  
        startTrial: (plan: Plan) => `Start trial (${plan.defaultTrialConfig.duration} days)`,  
        upgrade: 'Start now',
        custom: 'Contact us',  
        switchToBillingPeriod: billingPeriod => `Switch to ${billingPeriod.toLowerCase()}`,
        cancelScheduledUpdate: 'Cancel update',
    },  
    price: {  
        custom: 'Contact us',  
    },  
}

<Paywall

## Hooks

Use the `useStigg` React hook to access [Stigg's JavaScript client](javascript-sdk) easily from every component:

React

`import React from 'react';  
import { useStiggContext } from '@stigg/react-sdk';

function App() {  
  const { stigg } = useStiggContext();

  useEffect(() => {  
    // Use stigg Javascript client function  
    stigg.getBooleanEntitlement(...)  
  })  
}
`

## Handling a checkout

When initiating checkout using Stigg, the user is expected to be redirected and land on the successUrl destination page in the case of a successful payment or cancelUrl in case the user cancelled the checkout.

Due to the async nature of webhooks from Stripe, the subscription might not be yet provisioned in your Stigg account. To make sure that the new subscription has been activated in this scenario, you can utilize the `useWaitForCheckoutCompleted` custom hook to have an indication if the checkout is still in progress, succeeded or cancelled. 

React

`import { useWaitForCheckoutCompleted, ProvisionStatus } from '@stigg/react-sdk';

function Checkout(props) {
   const { isAwaitingCheckout, provisionStatus } = useWaitForCheckoutCompleted();
  
   if (isAwaitingCheckout && provisionStatus === ProvisionStatus.IN_PROGRESS) {
      // Show loading 
   } else if (provisionStatus === ProvisionStatus.SUCCEEDED) {
     // Subscription provisioned successfully
   } else {
     // Failed to provision subscription
   }
}
`

> ### 📘

> You can find `useWaitForCheckoutCompleted` hook API reference [here](https://react-sdk-docs.stigg.io/functions/usewaitforcheckoutcompleted)

## Refreshing the cache

Stigg's SDK refreshes its cache of customer entitlements and usage data upon initialization (for example: when a page is refreshed), as well as periodically every 30 seconds.

After performing an operation on the backend that can modify the customer entitlements or the usage of a feature (for example: updating subscriptions or reporting usage), it's useful to immediately refresh the cache.

To do so, call the below method:

React

`import { useStiggContext } from '@stigg/react-sdk';

function App() {
    const { stigg, refreshData } = useStiggContext();
  
  const addSeats = async () => {
    // Api call which modify customer entitlements (e.g. add seats or report usage)
    await api.addSeats();
    await refreshData();
  }
}

`
