<Warning> 
Triggering Zaps from webhooks requires a **paid** Zapier subscription
</Warning>

  
## Adding a webhook trigger in Zapier

In Zapier:

1. Click on "Create Zap".
2. Search for and select "Webhooks by Zapier".
3. From the "Trigger Event" dropdown menu select the "Catch Hook" trigger type.
4. Click "Continue".
5. Copy the generated webhook URL.
6. Click "Continue".
  
## Creating the webhook in Stigg

In Stigg:

1. Navigate to the Settings > Integrations > Webhooks screen.
2. Click on the "+ New webhook" button.
3. In the opened modal enter the following details:  
   1. Service name - the name of the service that is integrated with Stigg, for example: "Zapier"  
   2. Endpoint URL - the URL that was generated by Zapier.  
   3. Events to send - select the list of events that you'd like to send to this endpoint.

Click "Add" to confirm the action.

  
## Sending data to the webhook

In Stigg:

1. Click on the row of the newly created webhook from the webhook list screen in order to view the webhook details.
2. Under the "Webhook events" section, click on the dotted menu icon of the relevant event that you'd like to test, and select the "Send test event" action.
3. Click on "Send test event" to confirm the action.
  
## Testing the integration

In Zapier:

Click **Test trigger**.

If the data sent to the webhook URL is found, the step will show it was successful as well as the data received. Zapier will separate each field from your webhook data, which lets you use them (e.g. email addresses, names, project info) in later steps in your Zap.
