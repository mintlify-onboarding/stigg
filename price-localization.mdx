## Overview

Price localization allows you to expand to new markets by accommodating your product's pricing to the local willingness to pay. 

Stigg's price localization implementation can also be leveraged to test and gradually roll out pricing changes in specific geographies before applying the change to your main markets. 

Using Stigg's price localization functionality, you can:

1. Offer your products using different price points in different countries, for example: $X USD in the US, $Y USD in Israel.
2. Offer your product in the local currency per country, decoupled from the current conversion rate, for example: $X USD in the US, â‚¹Y INR in India.
3. Display the localized prices to customers on your public pricing page and in-app paywalls.
4. When Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (such as [Stripe](stripe)) - bill customers in their local currency, including invoicing, payment collection and receipt generation.

Customers in countries for which no localized pricing has been defined will automatically fall back to using the product's default pricing.

Rolling out price localization to your product can be achieved directly from the Stigg Console using no-code after the initial integration with Stigg.

## Limitations

1. Due to a [limitation in Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/questions/setting-a-customers-default-currency), once a customer has subscribed to a plan in a specific currency all subsequent subscriptions must be created using the same currency. The only current workaround for this is to create a new customer.
2. Due to the limitation in (1), after a subscription to a localized pricing has been created, the **currency** of the localized price **can't be updated**, and the **entire localized price can't be removed** \- only the value localized price points can be updated. This is intended to ensure that customers are always able to migrate to the latest plan and add-on version.
