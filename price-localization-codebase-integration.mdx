title: "Implementing price localization on your public website and application"
---

## Overview

In order to future-proof your public website and application for price localization, it's recommended to implement these changes as part of your initial integration with Stigg.

Doing so will allow you to introduce and rollout changes to the price localization configuration, without requiring any additional code changes.

<Warning>
1. When no localized pricing is defined for a specified country, the default pricing will be used.
2. If the customer has already subscribed to a plan with a localized price, its billing country code would **override** the one that's provided programatically.
</Warning>

## Visibility for localized prices in your public pricing page

```javascript React TSX
// fetch the billingCountryCode according to the visitor's IP

<Paywall
  highlightedPlanId="plan-id"
    billingCountryCode="DK" // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
  onPlanSelected={({ plan, customer }) => {
    // Handle customer intention to subscribe to plan
  }}
/>
```

## Visibility for localized prices in your in your application

### In-app paywall

```javascript React TSX
// fetch the billingCountryCode according to the customer's IP if they have never subscribed to a paid plan
// otherwise, the in-app paywall will be rendered according to the localized pricing that the customer has been subscribed to in the past

<Paywall
  highlightedPlanId="plan-id"
    billingCountryCode="DK" // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
  onPlanSelected={({ plan, customer }) => {
    // Handle customer intention to subscribe to plan
  }}
/>
```

### Customer portal

```javascript React TSX
// fetch the billingCountryCode according to the customer's IP if they have never subscribed to a paid plan

<CustomerPortal
    paywallComponent={
    <Paywall
    billingCountryCode="DK" // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
    onPlanSelected={({ plan, customer }) => {
      // Handle customer intention to subscribe to plan
    }}
    />
  }
/>
```

### Checkout

#### When estimating a subscription cost

If you're using your own checkout page, you can leverage Stigg's `estimateSubscription` method to present your customers with the estimated subscription cost, while taking price localization into consideration.

```javascript Node.js
// fetch billingCountryCode according to the customer's IP, billing address, etc.

await stiggClient.estimateSubscription({  
  customerId: "customer-demo-01",
  planId: "plan-revvenu-growth",
  unitQuantity: 2,                      // required for plans with per-unit pricing
  billingPeriod: "MONTHLY",
  addons: [{                                // optional
    addonId: "addon-10-campaigns",  
    quantity: 1  
  }],
  promotionCode: "STIGG50",     // optional
  billingCountryCode: "DK"      // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
});
```

#### When provisioning a subscription

When Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (for example: [Stripe](stripe)), and the `checkoutOptions` parameter is passed, customers will be redirected to a hosted checkout page that includes visibility for the localized price.

```javascript Node.js
// fetch billingCountryCode according to the customer's IP, billing address, etc.

const subscription = await stiggClient.provisionSubscription({  
    customerId: "customer-demo-01",  
    planId: "plan-basic",
    unitQuantity: 2,                                // optional, required for subscriptions with per-unit pricing  
    billingPeriod: "MONTHLY",           // optional, relevant only for paid subscriptions  
    addons: [{                                          // optional
        addonId: "addon-10-campaigns",  
        quantity: 1,  
    }],  
    billingCountryCode: "DK",           // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
      checkoutOptions: {                            // optional
      successUrl: "https://your-success-url.com",
        cancelUrl: "https://your-cancel-url.com",
      ...
    },
    awaitPaymentConfirmation: true,
    ...
});
```

## Provisioning subscriptions with localized pricing

```javascript Node.js
// fetch billingCountryCode according to the customer's IP, billing address, etc.

const subscription = await stiggClient.provisionSubscription({  
    customerId: "customer-demo-01",  
    planId: "plan-basic",
    unitQuantity: 2,                                // optional, required for subscriptions with per-unit pricing  
    billingPeriod: "MONTHLY",               // optional, relevant only for paid subscriptions  
    addons: [{                                          // optional
        addonId: "addon-10-campaigns",  
        quantity: 1,  
    }],  
    billingCountryCode: "DK",           // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
    awaitPaymentConfirmation: true,
    ...
});
```
