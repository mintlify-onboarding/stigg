As a pricing a packaging orchestration platform, Stigg can integrate with various third-party business applications. Once integrated, changes that are made on the Stigg platform auto-magically propagate to these applications. Some integrations also support propagation of changes back to Stigg.

Stigg supports 2 types of integrations:

1. Integration to specific apps using a Stigg-built connector.
2. Generic integration with any application using webhooks.

> Integrations are environment-specific. This allows you to test every integration before enabling it in your production environment.
