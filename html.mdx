## Overview

The Embed SDK is a Javascript library for presenting Stigg components in websites that are created using Webflow, Wordpress, or plain HTML.

Under the hood, the Embed SDK wraps the [React SDK](/react-sdk), and allows you to inject the same components into your website without including any other frameworks.

You can read more about the React SDK API reference [here](https://react-sdk-docs.stigg.io).

## Including the Embed SDK

To include the Embed SDK in the page, you need to add the following `<script>` tag to the `<body> `element:

```html HTML
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@stigg/[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)/dist/embed-sdk.js"></script>
```

You also need to include the styles in the `<head>` tag:

```html HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@stigg/[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)/dist/embed-sdk.css" />
```

  
## Retrieving the client API key

In the Stigg Cloud Console, go to [Settings > Account > Environments](https://app.stigg.io/account/settings).

Copy the   **Client API key** of the relevant environment.

  
## Getting started

You'll need to initialize the Embed SDK with your API key. For the list of additional parameters that can be passed please refer to the React SDK's `<StiggProvider/>` component.

```html HTML
<script>
  const stigg = Stigg({ apiKey: "YOUR-CLIENT-API-KEY" });
</script>
```

  
## Render pricing plans

Use the `Paywall` component to render the pricing plans in a public pricing page or a customer paywall:

![](/images/647544a-image.png)

#### Add the target container element to the DOM

```html HTML
<body>
  <div id="paywall"/>
</body>
```

#### Render the paywall

The stigg.Paywall function accepts the same properties as the Paywall component would. 

```html HTML
<script>
  const stigg = Stigg({
      apiKey: "YOUR-CLIENT-API-KEY",
      // You can ppass additional options 
      theme: {
        layout: {
          planMinWidth: '320px',
          planMaxWidth: '420px',
        },
      },
    });
  
    const paywall = stigg.Paywall({
      onPlanSelected: (...args) => {
        console.log('Plan selected', args);
      },
    });

    // mount the paywall to the container element
    paywall.mount('#paywall');
</script>
```

<Note>
You can find more paywall options [here](https://react-sdk-docs.stigg.io/).
</Note>

  
## Customization options

You can customize the paywall look and feel using the options that are supported by the React SDK. You can find more information about the options [here](/react-sdk#customization-options).
