## Overview

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/billing) is the fastest way for your business to bill customers with subscriptions or invoices, and accept recurring payments globally.

Stigg's native integration with Stripe enables:

1. Automatic propagation of changes from the Stigg platform to Stripe, including: changes to the product catalog (product, plans and add-ons, coupons), customers, subscriptions and their usage.
2. Automatic propagation of changes from Stripe to Stigg, including: subscription cancellations in Stigg when they're cancelled in Stripe.
3. Ability to leverage Stripe's hosted checkout page for customer checkout process, without needing to perform any additional integration with Stripe.
4. Ability to leverage Stripe's hosted billing portal to allow customers to update their billing details and payment method, as well as view past invoices, without needing to perform any additional integration with Stripe.

### Entity mapping

Stigg entities are mapped to Stripe entities as follows:

| Stigg Entity | Stripe Entity | Stripe Entity Name Format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Plan         | Product       | Plan for example: Acme Basic Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Every published plan is mapped to a dedicated Stripe product. Plan prices are versioned - when the price changes, a new price is created and the previous price is archived.     |
| Add-on       | Product       | Add-on for example: Acme 10 Seats Add-on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Every published add-on is mapped to a dedicated Stripe product. Add-on prices are versioned - when the price changes, a new price is created and the previous price is archived. |
| Coupon       | Coupon        | When a coupon is archived in Stigg, it's deleted in Stripe; therefore, the coupon cannot be applied to new customers. Existing customers that the coupon is applied to are not affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Customer     | Customer      | By default, the customer name and email in Stigg are synced to Stripe - the name is used as the customer name and description, and the email as the billing email address. It's also possible to report a different customer name to Stripe, which is useful for generating invoices with the full company name (i.e. customer name in Stigg is "Acme", and the customer name in Stripe will be "Acme Ltd."). |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Subscription | Subscription  | Due to a [limitation in Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/create), each customer can have at most 500 active subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Syncing customer usage to Stripe

When customers are subscribed to plans with usage-based pricing, the customer usage that's reported to Stigg is synced to Stripe **every hour**.

## Adding the Stripe integration in Stigg

In the [Stigg Console](https://app.stigg.io), under the **Settings > Integrations > Apps** section, select the Stripe connector.

If you're setting up the integration for development or testing purposes, toggle "Use Stripe test account" on.

Click "Connect with Stripe".

You'll be redirected to Stripe in order to complete the integration process.

In the opened screen click "Connect", and follow the instructions.

Once all of the integration steps on the Stripe side are completed, you'll be redirected back to Stigg.

## Indication for synced entities

Entities that are synced from Stigg to Stripe have a clickable "billing ID" property with a Stripe logo next to it and indication of their sync status (successful, failed, [will not be synced](#entities-that-are-not-synced-to-stripe)).

![](/images/61759f9-Screen_Shot_2022-03-31_at_18.59.04.png)

When attempting to add or edit entities that are synced to Stripe, there will be an indication that the change will also be reflected Stripe.

## Accessing Stigg entities from Stripe

In Stripe, under the "Metadata" section of the relevant entity, click on the link that appears under the "stiggEntityUrl" field.

## Integration with Stripe's Billing Portal

When Stigg is integrated with Stripe and using [Stigg's Customer Portal widget](/react-sdk#rendering-a-customer-portal), customers can update their billing information and view previous invoices directly from [Stripe's Billing Portal](https://stripe.com/docs/customer-management/get-started) (when it's enabled).

To ensure that the functionality of Stigg's Customer Portal doesn't collide with that of Stripe's Billing Portal, it's recommended to [configure Stripe's Billing Portal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) as follows:

1. Invoices  
   i. Invoice history - **enabled**
2. Customer information - **enabled**  
   i. Email address - **unchecked**  
   ii. Billing address - **checked**  
   iii. Phone number - **checked**
3. Payment methods  
   i. Payment method - **enabled**
4. Subscriptions  
   i. Cancel subscriptions - **disabled**  
   ii. Pause subscriptions - **disabled**  
   iii. Switch plans - **disabled**  
   iv. Update quantities - **disabled**

## Removing the integration from Stigg

To remove the integration, click on the dotted menu icon and select the "Remove" action.

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Remove" button in the opened modal.
