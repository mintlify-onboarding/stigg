## Overview

Stigg's Vue SDK is a Javascript library for embedding self-service components in Vue 3 apps.  
It is based on [React SDK](react-sdk) components under the hood.

  
## Prerequisites

### Installing Stigg's Vue SDK in Vue 3 applications

Install the `@stigg/vue-sdk` package in your project using one of the below method:

#### From npm:

Shell

`npm install @stigg/vue-sdk
`

#### From yarn:

Shell

`yarn add @stigg/vue-sdk
`

  
### Installing Stigg's Vue SDK in Vue 2 applications

Install the `@stigg/vue-2-sdk` package in your project using one of the below method:

#### From npm:

Shell

`npm install @stigg/vue-2-sdk
`

#### From yarn:

Shell

`yarn add @stigg/vue-2-sdk
`

  
## Retrieving the client API key

In the Stigg Cloud Console, go to [Settings > Account > Environments](https://app.stigg.io/account/settings).

Copy the   **Client API key** of the relevant environment.

  
## Getting started

Import the library CSS styles

TypeScript

`import '@stigg/vue-sdk/dist/style.css';
`

Configure the SDK by wrapping your application in `StiggProvider`:

Vue

`<script setup lang="ts">
import {StiggProvider} from '@stigg/vue-sdk';

const apiKey = "<STIGG_CLIENT_API_KEY>";
</script>

<template>
   <StiggProvider :apiKey="apiKey">
      <NestedComponents />
   </StiggProvider>
</template>
`

  
## Rendering pricing plans

Pricing tables allow your customers to select the plan that that they'd like to subscribe to. Plan pickers can be used on your **public pricing page**, as well as part of **in-app paywalls**.

One of the major benefits of leverage Stigg's pricing table widget, is that any change that you make to your pricing model is auto-magically reflected in the pricing table - no additional coding is required ðŸ˜Ž.

To render it, you'll need to import the `Paywall` component and place it under the `StiggProvider`. You can customize the pricing tables [using the same properties as the original React component has](react-sdk#customization-options). Use can use the exported TS types for the props as well.

Vue

`` <script setup lang="ts">
import {
  StiggProvider, StiggProviderProps, Paywall, PaywallProps
} from '@stigg/vue-sdk';

const stiggProvider: StiggProviderProps = {
  apiKey: "<STIGG_CLIENT_API_KEY>",
}

  
const paywall: PaywallProps = {
   onPlanSelected: ({plan}) => {
      console.log(`Selected plan: ${plan.displayName}`);
   }
}
</script>

<template>
   <StiggProvider v-bind="stiggProvider">
      <Paywall v-bind="paywall" />
   </StiggProvider>
</template>
 ``

## Rendering a customer portal

Stigg's customer portal widget allows you to introduce self-service and drive in-app expansions using only a few lines of codes. 

The customer portal:

1. Provides customers with visibility to their current subscription details - subscribed plan, purchased add-ons, granted promotional entitlements.
2. Provides customers with visibility to the usage of their subscription's features.
3. Allows customers to upgrade and downgrade their subscription in a self-served manner - when you update your pricing model in Stigg, customers will auto-magically be able to upgrade or downgrade their subscription according to the updated pricing model ðŸ˜Ž.
4. Allows customers to view their billing and payment information - when Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (such as Stripe), customers can also update this information and view previous invoices directly from the billing solution's billing portal.

The widget's layout, style and texts are [fully customizable](#customization-options) to suit your branding needs.

Use the `CustomerPortal` component to render the customer portal.

Vue

`<script setup lang="ts">
import {StiggProvider, CustomerPortal, CustomerPortalProps} from '@stigg/vue-sdk';

const apiKey = "<STIGG_CLIENT_API_KEY>";

const customerId = "<CUSTOMER-ID>";

const customerPortal: CustomerPortalProps = {
   onManageSubscription: () => {
     console.log('Manage subscription');
   }
}
</script>

<template>
   <StiggProvider :apiKey="apiKey" :customer-id="customerId">
      <CustomerPortal v-bind="customerPortal"/>
   </StiggProvider>
</template>
`
