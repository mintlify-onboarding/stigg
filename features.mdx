## Overview

The basic building blocks of the Stigg platform are **features**, which represent functionality in the product that can be monetized.

Defining features in Stigg allows you slice-and-dice your products in any way you'd like, while only requiring a **single** integration with your codebase for every new feature.

Features are usually defined by product managers, but can also be defined by engineers.

Stigg supports 3 types of features:

1. **Boolean features** \- represent functionality that customers can either have access to or not.
2. **Configuration features** \- represent functionality that can be configured, for example: the number of days for data retention.
3. **Metered features** \- represent functionality with varying usage that needs to be tracked, for example: number of seats, number of API calls made, etc.

## Viewing the list of available features

To view the list of available features, select the **Features** sub-section of the Product Catalog from the left navigation pane.

  
## Creating features

Creating new features in Stigg is possible by clicking on the "+ New feature" button in the Features sub-section of the Product Catalog.

Enter the below details in the opened modal:

1. Name - the name of the feature.
2. Description (optional) - the feature's description.
3. ID - will be auto-generated by Stigg. Use this ID to refer to the feature in your application. To link an existing feature, override the auto-generated value.

<Note>
The values that are entered in the “Name” and “Description” fields will be leveraged by Stigg to render the customer-facing paywall and customer portal; therefore, it’s recommended to use customer-friendly texts.
</Note>

  
### Creating boolean features

To create a boolean feature select the **Boolean** feature type.

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Create" button.

  
### Creating configuration features

<Note>
Stigg currently supports configuration features that have **numeric** values. For example: number of log retention days.
</Note>

To create a configuration feature, select the **Configuration** feature type.

Optionally edit the singular and plural unit names, for example: "day" and "days".

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Create" button.

  
### Creating metered features

To create a metered feature, select the **Meter** feature type.

Optionally edit the singular and plural unit names, for example: "seat" and "seats".

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Create" button.

  
### Importing an existing list of features

If you already have a large list using a large list of features in your application and would like to import them into Stigg, [let us know](mailto:support@stigg.io) and we'd be happy to assist you with the process.

  
## Storing metadata

It's possible to store metadata on each feature. The metadata can then be leveraged by the hosting application and third-party solutions via the Stigg SDKs, API and webhooks to implement custom functionality, for example: group features under a specific group in a pricing comparison table.

To store metadata on specific feature, under the "Metadata" tab of selected feature click on the "Add" (if there's no metadata) or "Edit" buttons.

Enter the relevant keys and values.

Click "Add" (if there was previously no metadata) or "Save changes" buttons to apply the changes.

## Editing feature details

To edit the details of a feature, select the relevant row from the feature list.

Update the value of the relevant fields.

Save the changes.

<Note>
Some properties of a feature (for example: its ID), cannot be modified after the feature is created.
</Note>

  
## Deleting features

To delete a feature click on the dotted menu icon of the relevant row, and select the "Delete" action.

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Delete" button in the opened modal.

<Warning>
It's not possible to delete a feature if it's in use by an existing plan or add-on.
