## Overview

Stigg supports the creation of multiple environments in each account in order to support your existing product development process, for example: Development, Staging, Production, etc.

Every environment is **isolated** from one another.

  
## Creating a new environment

To create a new environment, navigate to the Settings > Environment section.

Click on "+ Add".

Enter the environment name.

You may also add an optional description for the environment.

<Note> 
When a new environment is created, a default product for that environment will be automatically created. The product name will be the same name as the account name, for example: if your account name is "Acme", an "Acme" product will automatically be created in every newly created environment.
 
You can edit the name of the default product, or even remove it altogether and create a new one.
</Note>

  
## Duplicating an existing environment

You can duplicate the **product catalog** from an existing environment. This action is useful in the following cases:

1. When publishing your integration for the first time, for example: when publishing the integration that was implemented in the Development environment to the Staging environment, and when publishing the changes from the Staging environment to the Production environment
2. When implementing a pricing change - a new environment can be created for each code branch with the starting point of the production configuration.

Duplicating an existing environment can be achieved in the following flows:

1. During the creation of the new environment - select the environment that you'd like to duplicate the data from.
2. Under the Settings > Environment section by clicking on the dotted menu that appears in the row an existing environment and selecting the "Duplicate environment" action.
